Over the last two months I've started a journey (and it really is that) moving our legacy infrastructure into the cloud. The goal was serverless, fault-tolerant processing that was responsive to _events_ happening within our software infrastructure. I was inspired and motivated (and if I'm honest, a bit jealous) by my friend [Matthew's](http://matthewcrews.com) work creating a blog and carving out a space to talk about what we was doing professionally. I hope to do the same here.

My focus for a while is going to be primarily around  [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) and my efforts to move our infrastructure over, along with challenges and solutions I've come up with along the way. I'll probably throw in other programming-related things that strike my fancy as I go, as I do get to work on other interesting stuff that isn't cloud-focused.

If you are here, I'm glad you decided to stop and take a look. Feel free to connect with me if you find something that interests you.
