Systems analyst, application developer, systems programmer, and project designer on a number of projects for universities, businesses, and national labs. Projects have covered data scrubbing/transforms, messaging, network control systems, business rules engines, security, data mining, and ERP integrations. I am particularly interested in systems programming with emphasis on optimization and performance.
